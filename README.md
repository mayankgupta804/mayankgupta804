**Hello there, I'm Mayank.**

I like programming languages, distributed systems, the internet ecosystem and stuff that I am yet to discover.
I am naively optimistic with regards to the opinion that good software could help solve a lot of problems in the world.
At the same time, I assess softwares from a pessimistic perspective - the ones I write or help write included.

Currently, I am working as an engineer in the backend team at Squadcast, an end-to-end SRE platform that aims to
alleviate problems faced by engineers at various tech-startups and companies.
